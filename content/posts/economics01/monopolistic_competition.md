# Imperfect competition
Or how it is more commonly reffered to - Monopolistic competition.
Before it, in economics, there we're only two absolute of describing competition, perfect Utopian competition and the completely uncompetetive monopoly.
Most economics of the time we're preaching that perfect competition is the only way of handling the market, where a monopoly, same as now a days, is something that should be avoided.
