### Bevy - game engine built in Rust
The rust programming language has an actively growing community around open-source game engine [Bevy](https://bevy.org/)
It's quite light weight light weight, and you can make both 2d and even 3d games with it. It's also pretty easy to get started, thanks to its [Documentation and Examples Section](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/)

### Tricycle Asia
While I was traveling Southeast Asia, I eventually reached a point where I had run out of money, but I still had accommodation for month in a senior-retirement coastal City in the south of Vietnam - Nha Trang.
Between looking for english-teaching jobs, I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands, so I started learning Rust and developed this small game in Bevy called [Tricycle Asia](https://flopsis.itch.io/tricycle)
I made my own assets, animations and sound effects. The game is not balanced to be very fair, but I think it has its own charm!
